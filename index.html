                        <br><br>
                        At Cal Poly I have been a part of CPSEC and Cal Poly Racing, currently in WISH, and starting to be involved with CPUX. Outside of academics and clubs I am always keeping myself busy with entrepreneurial projects, training my new puppy Waylon, or hiking. I am excited to be on campus and involved more than I was able to online, for my last year at Cal Poly! I had a great experience interning at VMware remotely for 12 weeks this summer! I was hired for the role of Software Engineering Intern on the Remote Experience team. My team's focus was to enhance the Microsoft Teams software built for our Horizon Client VDI. My role as intern was to create a solution for understanding call failures since it was information Microsoft did not actively release to my team. To do this I intercepted voice and audio call data to then develop a cross-platform native application using webRTC to display understandable diagnostics that helped both the developers on my team and customer service aid in call failures. I got a puppy!!!!!! He has grown up so much already. Also - finally met all my friends that I've been talking to online for over a year now. That was amazing. We went on to the bluff trail at MDO.

                        Some of my hobbies include video games, art, cosplay, anime, and programming. I intern part-time for Northrop Grumman as a Software Engineering intern, and have been interning there since age 16. In my free time, I enjoy going to clubs, such as Hack4Impact, and doing community service activities related to CS. During the summer, I worked full-time as a Software Engineering intern for Northrop Grumman for a 3rd summer in a row. I worked with C++ and C# to help develop software to route air vehicles. This experience helped me become a better programmer. It also showed me how what I am learning in my college courses apply to the real world. I also got a part-time offer after my internship, so I am interning part-time for Northrop Grumman remotely over the school year. After my internship, I went to Disneyland for 3 days with my high school friends before moving to Cal Poly. My favorite part, although expensive, was building both a lightsaber and droid at Galaxy's Edge. I also got to see Marvel Land in California Adventure for the first time. I dyed my hair fire-colored over the summer, so that was fun.

                        I like programming, anime, video games, cooking, blogging (http://aay.tw), and hiking! I'm
                        secretary of the Cal Poly Linux Users Group, which you should definitely join if you touch
                        Linux/Unix in any way at all. I'm also a member of Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club, Transgender and
                        Queer Student Union, and of course, WISH! I interned at Facebook for 12 weeks as a production
                        engineer! I created a service that automatically tests a component of the Facebook Live video
                        streaming infrastructure. I bought a very cheap rack server off eBay and I've been doing silly
                        things with it, like running Minecraft servers or compiling large Rust projects.

                        I like to play tennis, hike, lay in my hammock, and I've been learning how to climb! I'm in
                        WISH, Hack4Impact, and Club Tennis. This summer, I interned at Microsoft as an Explore Intern
                        for 12 weeks. I interned for Clarity (a web analytics tool) on the frontend team. I spent 4
                        weeks doing program management where I learned about the PM mindset and how to write
                        specs/documentation. And for the 8 weeks, I was able to do dev work and push some of my code
                        into production! I camped at Mount Rainier for a few days where I did the Skyline and Burroughs
                        Trail. I also took a day trip to Oregon where I explored Portland and visited Cannon Beach. At
                        the end of the summer, I road tripped from Seattle to SLO where I stopped again in Portland,
                        explored San Francisco, and went down the PCH from the Bay to SLO (so many cute seals!)

                        language on a scholarship in Montepulciano, which is a small hill town in Tuscany. After Italy,
                        I went to Poland to see family and meet up with my parents and siblings. From there we went to
                        Iceland and had so many fun adventures there from hiking the volcano to ice climbing on the
                        glacier!
